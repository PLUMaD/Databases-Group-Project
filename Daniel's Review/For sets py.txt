We need to have defined functions for the app.py to call in order to use SQL.

I think we only need update and select, but that may be too easy. 
If you are concerned, please discuss. 

I may be asleep during the meeting, as when I checked the app.py and sets.py, I saw they had many errors in VSCode.
I worked all night and may actually sleep through the day. I apologize.

If more SQL is needed, the zybook and a google chrome extension called grepper are good sources.
You can also ask Professor.

Also, I noticed I could have made all of my tables use the same column names, and made the SQL easier to use.
If you decide to do that, please be sure to update the csv files, create tables SQL, and the insert rows SQL.
