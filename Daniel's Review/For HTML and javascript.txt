I have no advice, for this other than reference the last project, online resources, the class discord, and Professor.

I'm sorry to potentially be gone for part of/all of today.

I meant to help with the html url, jinja, hidden inputs, setting up queries, and maybe doing some javascript, but I did
not expect to work through last night.

I will jump into our discord right when I wake, so if I am needed for anything or can help,
just fill me in and I'll get to work.

We can explain each page in more detail.
Like, the Page title will ask a question using a keyword and topic. Based on the given keyword and topic, you will get two options.
Clicking on an option answers the question for the page and you will be shown the amount of people who chose like you.
From there, the question and options will update based on your answer to the previous question.
