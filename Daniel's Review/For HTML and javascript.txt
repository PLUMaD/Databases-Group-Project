I have no advice, for this other than reference the last project, online resources, the class discord, and Professor.

I'm sorry to potentially be gone for part of/all of today.

I meant to help with the html url, jinja, hidden inputs, setting up queries, and maybe doing some javascript, but I did
not expect to work through last night.

I will jump into our discord right when I wake, so if I am needed for anything or can help,
just fill me in and I'll get to work.
