We will likely need three route statements for the three types of pages:
I made a quick sample in this folder

The imports on my end need pylint to be rerouted to our project directory.
If that is a problem when tested, please message professor in discord for help, immediately.

Also, the sample will probbly need to be moved out from this Daniel's Review folder 
to where the actual app.py is to import the utils folder and access the sample sets.py
